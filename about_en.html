        <p>DS - GameStudio is an independent game development studio from Moldova, founded in 2023 with one goal: to create unique, atmospheric, and memorable game worlds. </p>
<p>🚀 Our Beginning
It all started in early 2023, when a group of friends, united by a love for video games, decided to turn their passion into a profession.
We are a team from Moldova — a country rich in culture, which inspires us to create original stories and visual styles.

Our first steps were simple projects — 2D platformers and mini-games.
But month by month, we improved, explored game engines in depth, experimented with genres and mechanics, and learned to work like a true studio.

<p>🎮 Who We Are Today, 
<p>DS - GameStudio is:</p>
</p>
<p>👨‍💻 A united team of developers, game designers, artists, and writers;
</p>
<p>🌍 Projects that resonate not only in Moldova but beyond its borders;
</p>
<p>🛠 Constant growth and adoption of new technologies (Unity, Godot, Unreal Engine, and more);
</p>
<p>❤️ A sincere love for games and for the people who play them.
</p>
<p>✨ Our Games
<p>Among our flagship projects:</p>
</p>
<p> </p>
Thronebound — a fantasy 2D platformer about a knight in a forgotten kingdom;

TBS - TotalBattleStrike — a fast-paced modern military shooter.

<p>Each game we create is a world where gameplay blends with story — every level crafted with care and passion.
</p>
🔮 What’s Next?
<p>We’re not planning to stop.
Our ambition is to reach the international market, take part in game expos, launch large-scale projects — and perhaps one day, build our own game universe.

<p> We believe that big ideas are born in small studios. And it’s those ideas that drive us forward.</p>
